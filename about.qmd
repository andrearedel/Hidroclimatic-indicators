# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Andrea Redel

I was born, raised, and educated in Chile, and I currently live in Switzerland. Iâ€™m a Forest Engineer passionate about spatial analysis applied to landscape, conservation, and climate challenges.

Before studying Forest Engineering, I initially pursued a degree in Agronomy. At the core of my interests lies the deep interdependence between humans and nature, and the responsibility we have to manage it wisely.
