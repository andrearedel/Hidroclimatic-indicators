## Welcome to my site on conservation, landscape, and climate change

Here I present various visualizations, analyses, documentation, and methodologies related to landscape and forest analysis for the study of conservation and climate change.

This project is under continuous development. You can check out the source code on my <a href="https://github.com/andrearedel" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
